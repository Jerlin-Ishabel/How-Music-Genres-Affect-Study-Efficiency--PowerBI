🎵 How Music Genres Affect Study Efficiency – A Power BI Exploration
In today's fast-paced academic environment, students often turn to music as a companion during study sessions. But have you ever wondered — does the genre of music really influence how well you study?
As a passionate data enthusiast, I explored this question using Power BI by analyzing how different music genres impact study efficiency through factors like retention score, mood, focus level, and study habits.

🧠 Project Overview
This project titled "How Music Genres Affect Study Efficiency" dives into a dataset of 100 students. The dataset includes various fields such as:
Age, Gender, and Major
Study Duration and Time
Music Genre Listened
Retention Score (%)
Mood, Focus Level (1–10), Sleep Quality
Device Used, Background Noise, Caffeine Intake, Note-Taking Style
The aim was to find meaningful insights into how these variables — especially music genre — correlate with study performance.

🛠️ Tools Used
Power BI for dashboard design and visual analytics
Excel for data cleaning and preprocessing
Custom formatting to convert categorical values into analyzable formats (e.g., Yes/No ➝ 1/0)

📊 Charts & Visuals Used
To tell the story effectively, I used a mix of interactive visuals:
Bar Charts: Retention by Genre, Study Time by Genre
Pie/Donut Charts: Mood and Device usage distributions
Heatmap (Matrix): Mood vs Genre vs Retention Score
Stacked Columns: Genre vs Focus Level vs Gender
Line & Area Charts: Study Duration patterns
Bubble Chart: Genre vs Study Duration vs Retention
Tree Map: Genre distribution among students
Summary Table: All genre-wise average values

✨ Key Insights
🔍 After analyzing the visuals, here’s what I found:
🎷 Jazz and Lo-Fi music listeners had the highest average retention scores.
📱 Students using laptops and studying at night performed better.
😀 Students in a happy or neutral mood retained more than those who were stressed.
📊 Interestingly, longer study sessions did not always result in better retention.
🌟 Genre + Mood + Focus formed a strong trio influencing retention.

✅ Tips for Fellow Learners
If you're working on your own data project in Power BI:
Clean and format your data before visualization.
Let each chart answer one specific question.
Use consistent color coding for categories like genre or mood.
Add slicers for interactivity — make your report clickable and dynamic.
Use cards and KPIs to summarize metrics like average retention or total participants.

🏁 Conclusion 
This Power BI dashboard allowed me to uncover powerful correlations between music preferences and study performance. It proves how data visualization can turn raw responses into actionable insights — a valuable skill for data analysts, educators, and students alike.
